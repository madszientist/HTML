<div>My most recent getaway was to an Ashram in the Bahamas.  It was a very interesting experience, as it was less a vacation and more of a learning experience. We spent most of our day practicing yoga or helping in the communal kitchen preparing breakfast or dinner for the group of visitors and those enrolled in the YTT program.  It was the first getaway to an island country that I did not spend any time relaxing on the beach or by a pool, but it was a wonderful and intraspective experience.</div>

<p>Here is a list of my favorite pet names with the corresponding animal.</p>
<ol> <li>Landmine - Schnauzer (Dog)</li>
<li>Packwood - Pumi (Dog)</li>
<li>James Earl Jones - Persian (Cat)</li> </ol>

<P>My favorite local restaurant is <a href= "https://piscessushi.com/charlotte" target="_blank">Pisces Sushi Lounge</a>
Here are a few reasons why it is my favorite:
    <ul><li>The sushi is fresh</li>
    <li>They do not advertise "Sushi-Grade fish" (as that should be a given)</li>
    <li>Their food score is above 95 and prominently displayed, which calms my inner food nerd</li></ul></P>
